Explanation:

Test Case 11: Chef needs to increase his worth by 200−100=100200−100=100 billion dollars and his increment per year being 1010 billion dollars, so it will take him 10010=1010100​=10 years to do so.

Test Case 22: Chef needs to increase his worth by 199−111=88199−111=88 billion dollars and his increment per year being 1111 billion dollars, so it will take him 8811=81188​=8 years to do so.

Test Case 33: Chef needs to increase his worth by 200−190=10200−190=10 billion dollars and his increment per year being 1010 billion dollars, so it will take him 1010=11010​=1 year to do so.
